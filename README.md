Hello World!

My name is Dylan and I am serious about learning to code.
Since I've started with html and css I haven't gone a day without learning something new.
I have a strong yearning for something new every day, and hope to polish my skills to hireable levels.

If anyone has any recommendations or constructive advise, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I can use all the help I can get :)
